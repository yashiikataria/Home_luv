## Coding Guidelines
 
### Editor

You can choose any editor for development. Some of our favorites are VS Code, XCode (Swift). Please have the editor already installed on your machine before the test.

### Knowledge of GIT
It is our assumption that you have a basic knowledge of GIT.

## Branch and Commits

You will find assignment in following branches for each day. Suppose today is your first day, then the branch name will be 2023/day-one. 
Before developing you need to clone this branch, and check in code in following format
[Current Year]/[day-<day>][First Letter of FirstName][LastName]
  
### Example
Branch Name for Candidate "Apple Seed", current year 2023, day 1 will be  
```
  2023/day-one-aseed
``` 
 

## Tips
* Use consistent coding standards.
* Code should be self explanatory.
* Always ask questions before writing code. Lot of times problem statements are ambigious.
* It is more important how you solve the problem, as compared to reaching to a solution by hit and trial.
